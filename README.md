This guide will help you to learn PHP Symfony 6 Framework basics. The concepts in this course include:
* Basic of handling requests
* Twig templates
* Databases and Doctrine
* Doctrine Relations
* Querying the database
* Authentication (registration, e-mail confirmation, login page, banning users)
* Authorization of users (roles, voters)
* User permission system (role-based)
* File uploads and displaying uploaded images
* Sending e-mail

You'll learn all this while building a fun and interesting project, a Twitter-like clone, using the most modern CSS framework Tailwind CSS.

## Get Started

### Setup / Installation

#### PHP 8.1
PHP will be used  to run a built-in server and run console commands. Install PHP 8.1 or higher. Download the Thread safe version [here](https://windows.php.net/download#php-8.1).

<details><summary><b>Show Steps</b></summary>

1. Extract the downloaded zip file in ```C:\Program Files\``` directory.

2. Copy the full directory of the extracted folder.

3. Now click on Start Menu and search ```Environment variables``` and open it.

4. Under System variables, add a new value inside the ```Path``` variable and paste the full directory in step 2.

5. Save your changes and check the php version in command prompt.

    ```shell
    php --version
    PHP 8.1.13 (cli) (built: Nov 22 2022 15:49:14) (ZTS Visual C++ 2019 x64)
    Copyright (c) The PHP Group
    Zend Engine v4.1.13, Copyright (c) Zend Technologies
    ```

</details>

#### Composer
Composer will be used to install PHP packages. Download it [here](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

<details><summary><b>Show Installations</b></summary>

1. Windows Installer - The installer, which requires that you have PHP already installed, will download Composer for you and set up your PATH environment variable so you can simply call composer from any directory. Download and run [Composer-Setup.exe](https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe) - it will install the latest composer version whenever it is executed.

2. Command-line installation - To quickly install Composer in the current directory, run the following script in your terminal. Use this [guide to install Composer programatically](https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/how-to-install-composer-programmatically.md).

    ```sh
    php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
    php -r "if (hash_file('sha384', 'composer-setup.php') === '55ce33d7678c5a611085589f1f3ddf8b3c52d662cd01d4ba75c0ee0459970c2200a51f492d557530c71c15d8dba01eae') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
    php composer-setup.php
    php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
    ```

</details>

#### Symfony CLI
Download the 386 binaries [here](https://symfony.com/download).

<details><summary><b>Show Installations</b></summary>
  
  1. Extract the ZIP file to C:\symfony-cli.
  
  2. Add to the Path environment variable under ***User Variables***.
  
  3. Run ```symfony``` in terminal to see the CLI version and commands.

  </p>

</details>

#### Docker
Docker will be used to run a database server and db admin panel.

## Symfony 101

### Creating Project
Open your console terminal and run any of these commands to create a new Symfony application:

#### Symfony-cli:
```shell
symfony new my_project_directory --version="6.2.*"
```

#### Composer:
```shell
composer create-project symfony/skeleton:"6.2.*" my_project_directory
cd my_project_directory
composer require webapp
```

### Symfony Check

#### Technical Requirements
```shell
symfony check:requirements
```

#### Security
```shell
symfony check:security
```

### Project Structure
* ```config/```     - Contains all configuration files such as routes, services and packages.
* ```migrations/``` - Contains all doctrine migration class files.
* ```src/```        - Contains all PHP code.
* ```templates/```  - Contains all Twig templates.
* ```bin/```        - Contains files for the bin/console command.
* ```var/```        - Contains all automatically-created files like cache files and logs.
* ```vendor/```     - Contains all third-party libraries. These are downloaded via the Composer package manager.
* ```public/```     - It is the document root of the project where any publicly accessible files are contained.

#### Running Symfony Applications
For local development, the most convenient way of running Symfony is by using the local web server provided by the symfony binary.

##### Using Symfony CLI to use Local Web Server

```shell
# Run server in background with -d
symfony server:start -d
```

#### Route and Controller
A **Route** is the URL (e.g. /about) to your page and points to a controller.

A **Controller** is the PHP function you write that builds the page. You take the incoming request information and use it to create a Symfony Response object, which can hold HTML content, a JSON string or even a binary file like an image or PDF.

##### Creating new controllers
After running the command, a new ```controller``` and its ```twig``` file is created in their respective directory.

```shell
php bin/console make:controller
```
